# Mapping Assistant

Mapping Assistant is a Windows desktop toolkit for creating and
maintaining Unreal Tournament 1999 maps. It brings frequently used mapping,
image, scripting, documentation, and planning tools together in
one easy-to-navigate application.

## Download

[Download the latest Windows release](https://github.com/Ronneh/Mapping-Assistant/releases/latest)

Open the release page, download **Mapping Assistant v5.zip** from its
**Assets** section, extract the complete archive, and run
**Mapping Assistant v5.exe**. Keep the `app`, `runtime`, and
`help-content` folders next to the executable; the application is not designed
to run from the EXE alone.

The Windows build is currently unsigned, so Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may
show a warning after download. Verify that the archive comes from this GitHub
repository before running it.

### Building the Windows app image

From PowerShell, run
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\package-windows.ps1`. The
process-scoped bypass does not alter the system execution policy. The script
performs the normal Maven build, verifies that tutorial-editor classes are
absent, generates a multi-resolution Windows icon from `app-icon.png`, passes
it explicitly to `jpackage`, and checks the packaged launcher for the canonical
icon. By default, the v5 app image is written below `target\windows-release`.

## Development setup

- Install **Git** and a **JDK 17**.
- Clone the repository, e.g., with `git clone https://github.com/Ronneh/Mapping-Assistant.git`.
- Open the cloned **Mapping-Assistant** root folder (the folder containing
  `pom.xml`) in an IDE with Maven support, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or
  Visual Studio Code with the Java extensions.
- In PowerShell or Command Prompt, change to the project folder location, e.g., 
  with `cd source\repos\Mapping-Assistant` and run `.\mvnw.cmd test` to
  compile the project and execute its tests.
- Run `.\mvnw.cmd package` to create the application JAR in the `target` folder.
- Start the application from the source tree with
  `.\mvnw.cmd exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=MappingAssistant"`.

## Features

### Map building and duplicating

- **Brush Generator** creates grid-aligned polygon cylinder brushes for common CSG
  shapes and exports them as T3D data.
- **Brush Optimizer** checks pasted T3D brushes for off-grid vertices,
  planarity problems, and alignment issues. Every proposed change can be
  reviewed before the corrected map data is copied.
- **Prefab Explorer** organizes T3D/TXT prefabs in folders, edits raw code and
  shows selectable animated brush previews, with search, undo/redo and safe auto-save.
- **Double** prepares duplicated team-based map content for the opposite
  team by updating FlagBases, PlayerStarts, Tags, and Events.

### Screenshots and Textures

- **Screenshot Maker** imports 4 map screenshots, lets you choose each
  square crop, arrange the four panels, add styled labels, and export a PNG file.
- **Image Resizer** opens images and turns them into square, Unreal-friendly
  PNG textures. Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, and sharpness can be
  adjusted before export.
- **Seamless Texture** creates a mirrored, tileable texture from a source image.

### UnrealScript and Editor Guide

- **Scripting** provides an UnrealScript editor, reusable examples, basic
  checks, and UCC package compilation support.
- **Editor Guide** contains a big collection of Unreal Editor 2
  reference pages and community tutorials, with contents and search.

### Planning and daily information

- **To-Do List** organizes notes and tasks in folders, with rich-text editing
  and automatic local storage.
- **Weather** shows a seven-day forecast.

## Notes

- The application is intended for the game Unreal Tournament 1999 and Unreal Editor 2.
- Weather information requires an internet connection.
- On first use, Weather asks for a city instead of assuming a default location.
  City search requires an internet connection and presents matching places by
  region and country. The last successful forecast is cached locally for
  offline display. Weather preferences and the cache are stored below
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MappingAssistant` on Windows. Existing data from
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UnrealEditor2Assistant` is migrated automatically.

## Third-party services and acknowledgements

Mapping Assistant is made possible by several external services,
open-source projects, and community resources:

- **Open-Meteo** provides the geocoding and forecast data used by the Weather
  feature. Thank you for making accessible weather APIs available without
  requiring an API key.
- **Apache Lucene** powers the local full-text search in Editor Help.
- **jsoup** is used to import, clean, and present the historical HTML help
  pages.
- **Jackson** reads and writes the Editor Guide metadata and local Weather
  configuration.
- **Java Native Access (JNA)** enables Windows-specific desktop integration.
- **The Unreal and Unreal Tournament editing community** created the reference
  guides and tutorials preserved in Editor Help. Thanks to the original
  authors, archivists, and community sites that shared this knowledge.
- **Epic Games** created Unreal, Unreal Tournament, UnrealEd, and the technology
  this companion application is designed to support.
